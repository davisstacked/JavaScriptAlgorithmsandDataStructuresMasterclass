  <title>Big O Space Complexity</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Space Complexity in JS</h1>
  <ul>
    Rules of Thumb
    <li>Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space</li>
    <li>Strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length)</li>
    <li>Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)</li>
    <li>The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that's less than or equal to one.</li>
  </ul>
