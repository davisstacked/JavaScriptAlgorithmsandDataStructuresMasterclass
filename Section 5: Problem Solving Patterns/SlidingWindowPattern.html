  <h1>Sliding Windows Pattern</h1>
  <p>This pattern involves creating a WINDOW which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created). Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.</p>
