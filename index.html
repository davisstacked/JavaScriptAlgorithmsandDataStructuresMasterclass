    <h4>TIMING OUR CODE 2.5</h4>
    <h5>What does better mean?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Faster?</li>
        <li>Less memory-intensive?</li>
        <li>More readable?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>miliseconds is a 1000 seconds. how we count time in computer speed - miliseconds</p>

    <h5>The Problem with Time</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Different machines will record different times</li>
        <li>The same machine will record different times!</li>
        <li>For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>COUNTING OPERATIONS 2.6</h4>
    <p>Depending on what we count, the number of operations can be as low as 2n or as high as 5n +2. But regardless of the exact number, the number of operations grows roughly <span>proportionally with n</span></p>

    <h4>Visualizing Time Complexities 2.7</h4>

    <a href="https://rithmschool.github.io/function-timer-demo/">Performance Tracker for Big O that professor created - runs functions from this section of the course</a>

    <p>A microsecond is one millionth of a second</p>

    <p>number of operations performed negatively impacts speed of performance</p>

    <h4>OFFICIAL INTRO TO BIG O 2.7</h4>
    <p>Big O Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting</p>
    <p>It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow.</p>
    <p>We don't care about details - only broad trends.</p>

    <h5>Big O Definition</h5>
    <p>We say that an algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n), as n increases.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>f(n) could be linear (f(n) = n)</li>
        <li>f(n) could be quadratic (f(n) = n2)</li>
        <li>f(n) could be constant (f(n) = 1</li>
        <li>f(n) could be something entirely different!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In mathematics, the term <strong>quadratic</strong> describes something that pertains to squares, to the operation of squaring, to terms of the second degree, or equations or formulas that involve such terms. Quadratus is Latin for square.</p>

    <p>When we're talking about Big O we're talking about The Worst Case Scenario - the upper-bound for run-time</p>

    <p>** O(n) operation inside of an O(n) operation (like nested loops) is O(n2) - an exponential curve which has a steep run-time increase.</p>
